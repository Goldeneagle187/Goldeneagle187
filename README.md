# Hi, I am Samindra Ray

Botany student exploring fungal biology, plant tissue culture, and sustainable cultivation techniques. Passionate about the science behind growth — from grafting and micropropagation to soil health and organic fertilizers.

## Areas of Interest
- Plant tissue culture & callus induction
- Fungal biology & applied mycology
- Grafting and advanced propagation methods
- Soil science, composting, and natural fertilizers
- Laboratory techniques: autoclaving, sterilization, laminar flow work
- Data tracking and basic automation to support research
- A little bit of coding (Mostly elementary frontend work)

## Currently Working On
- Optimizing media formulations for challenging species
- Documenting grafting success rates across cultivars
- Integrating tools to streamline lab and field notes
